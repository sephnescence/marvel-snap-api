I moved to a new Mac after initialising this. Naturally that means my vendor folder didn't follow me as it's in the gitignore. To get around this I ended up doing the following
1. Install Brew - https://brew.sh/
  1. Be sure to follow the special notes section. In this case it gave me two lines to run in my terminal to add brew to my path
1. Close that terminal window and open another one
1. Make sure Brew is up to date `brew update`
1. Then run `brew install php`
  1. It offered to run php on startup. I'm not sure if I need to but I'll leave it here for reference - `brew services start php`
1. 
1. Then install composer. Instructions at https://getcomposer.org/download/
  1. `php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"`
  1. `php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55ce33d7678c5a611085589f1f3ddf8b3c52d662cd01d4ba75c0ee0459970c2200a51f492d557530c71c15d8dba01eae') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"`
  1. `php composer-setup.php`
  1. `sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`
1. Close that terminal window and open another one
1. `composer install`

And after all that I don't have a .env file lol. So I give up. I'm just going to regenerate the app. Turns out I had to anyways as I'm not on an M2 and packages changed. Like selenium to seleniarm

I finally tracked this down in the docs though... Not sure if `--ignore-platform-reqs` would have meant that it would have installed intel mac stuff instead of silicon ðŸ¤·
```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
